            Hello and welcome to my story resum√©, this is an exercise for CeroUno.io Apprenticeship Summer Camp for 2018 where I‚Äôm learning Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and mostly how to think as a coder.

            Professional Experience
          </h2>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve done a lot of stuff during my life, I‚Äôm 32 years old right now and I fortunatenly have been involved in many different industries and initiatives.
          </p>

          <p>  
            I‚Äôm currently working at <span class="company">Icalia Labs as the CFO</span>. I'm in charge of Modelling, Revenue forecasting, Accounting, Fiscal & Legal Compliance, Cashflow planning, Credit Management and a whole lot of of other stuff. <strong>We‚Äôve managed to grow the company 80% last year</strong>, and we are hoping to continue that trend, diversifiying services and making improvements on our operations. <u>Something I really like about Icalia is the openness and collaboration of everyone inside the organization</u>, this fact gives me a window to do a lot of more diverse stuff like tweaking the Legal Framework, for it to be more efficient and to diminish important risks for the company, doing Business Process Mapping for the software development operations together with the COO, setting up KPIs on different departments and automating administrative tasks as well.

            Academic Background
          </h2>
          <p>
            I really like studying, I believe that every time you learn a new topic, it opens you a completely different perspective on what reality is and how the world works.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last time I was in a school was around 5 years ago, fortunately, at <span class="school">Copenhagen Business School</span> in Denmark, where I got my <strong>Masters Degree of Economics and Business Administration</strong>, it was an amazing time, I learned lots from amazing teachers who pushed you further with guidance and knowledge. While being there, I had the opportunity to delve deep into a very interesting topic ‚ÄúNeuromarketing‚Äù and I ended up writing my thesis about it, specifically about <u>how to (correctly) use facial expressions in advertising to communicate emotions</u>, I did a framework and everything, it was a really fun and though experience (I had to read a Neuroscience book to be able to understand a lot of concepts), it was cool.

            Courses & Learning
          </h2>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve been taking courses every now and then, since life has been pushing me to work more and more, and getting into more projects, my way to satiate my need of knowledge has been through courses (and audible üòâ).
          </p>
          <p>
          Well, you already know that I‚Äôm studying programming right now, but the last couple of courses I took where from Coursera, which is a great way to obtain knowledge on several topics.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Model Thinking</strong> was an amazing course that helped me use models to understand and communicate abstract ideas, while I also learned a lot from an <strong>Introduction to Psychology</strong> and <strong>Social Psychology</strong> too which is an amazing topic that makes you learn a lot of human behavior, and that is an amazing tool for a world full of humans.

          <h2>
            Skills & Interests
          </h2>
          <p>
          In all honesty, I‚Äôve always felt that need to learn more, and that has been one of my weird main interest, simply learning new stuff all the time.
          </p>
          <p>
          Regarding this resum√©, I know you need me to tell you the following, I know how to <strong>speak and write business english fluently</strong>, <strong>Spanish too since I was born in M√©xico</strong>, and I learned a little bit of <strong>Danish</strong> (I took a 6 month course while in Denmark), and some <strong>Swedish</strong> too. The next language I‚Äôm studying is gonna be French, because I‚Äôm interested in living a while over there, it seems like a great place where I can be happy in the coldness of snow, and the warmth of a multicultural society.
          </p>
          <p>
          Regarding my skills, I cannot speak for myself, but others can, and I can tell you what other‚Äôs have said, seems fair? I hope so, so here it goes.
        </p>
        <p> 
          People talk to me about <strong>New Business Ideas</strong> so I can bounce with them some insights on where could there be a good business opportunity and what would it take to take advantage of it, and <U>how to structure a potential organization that could achieve the business goals</U>. They seek me for <U>finance guidance, on investing, how to save money</u>, even on topics related of <U>cashflow, collection, taxes, and stuff like that</U>. I also enjoy talking about economics, politics and philosophy, and some people seek to talk weird things questioning the nature of reality and society, which I also really enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my interests, well they are very diverse, I can tell you right now I‚Äôm really into meditation (check out the audiobook called the science of enlightenment, it‚Äôs amazing) and well, really any kind of knowledge, I‚Äôm also always looking for business opportunities, that‚Äôs very fun too.
